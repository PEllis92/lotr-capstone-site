          <h2 id="lorien">The Land of Lothlórien</h2>
          <img src="images/Lorien_1.png" alt="Lothlórien, the Golden Wood" />
          <p>
            Lothlórien, the fairest of the Elven realms in Middle-Earth, was a
            timeless land of beauty and light, ruled by Galadriel and Celeborn
            from their city in the trees, Caras Galadhon. This enchanted forest,
            located between the Misty Mountains and the River Anduin, stood as a
            bastion of Elven resistance against the Dark Lord Sauron. With the
            power of Galadriel's Ring, the forest remained hidden from Sauron's
            gaze, offering a safe haven to the Company of the Ring during their
            journey. However, after the War of the Ring, the Elves could no
            longer preserve Lothlórien. The Rings no longer held the power.
            Lorien began to slow decay, and eventually, the Lorien Elves
            departed. Legolas, many years later, visited the now empty realm,
            describing it as a quiet, lifeless place where the trees had lost
            their color. After Legolas's departure, his father, Thranduil,
            remained the last Elven King in Middle-Earth. Together with the
            remaining Elves of Mirkwood and Avari; Thranduil led the final Elven
            march to the Grey Havens. As they passed through the fading woods of
            Lothlórien, the Elves gave one last farewell with a blast from their
            Elven horns, marking the end of an age as they departed for the
            Undying Lands to never return again.

          <h2 id="rivendell">The Land of Rivendell</h2>
          <img
            src="images/Rivdendell_1.png"
            alt="Rivendell, the Last Homely House"
          />
          <p>
            Rivendell, also known as Imladris, is a hidden valley nestled at the
            foot of the Misty Mountains, east of the Trollshaws. It is renowned
            as the home of Elrond, the Half-Elf lord, and serves as a sanctuary
            for Elves, travelers, scholars, and adventurers. The valley is a
            place of healing, wisdom, and peace, where the gentle beauty of the
            land reflects the serenity of its inhabitants. At sunset, the hills
            glow with a soft pink and yellow hue, creating a picturesque view
            from the Last Homely House, Elrond's residence, located near the
            Falls of Imladris. It is here that Frodo Baggins, wounded by the
            Morgul blade, was brought to safety. Elrond's House is also the
            center of knowledge, housing Elrond's vast library filled with
            ancient tomes and scrolls. Scholars from all over Middle-Earth come
            to study in the Scholar's Guild hall, and adventurers often seek
            Elrond's wisdom and counsel. In The Fellowship of the Ring, Bilbo
            described Rivendell as “a perfect house,” where visitors could find
            rest, healing, and peace. Its warm hearth, quiet rooms, and rich
            stories were a cure for weariness and fear. It became a haven for
            many during the dark times of the War of the Ring, and its influence
            was crucial in shaping the fate of Middle-Earth. After the War of
            the Ring, Elrond left Rivendell. The final visitors to the Last
            Homely House were Celeborn Lord of Lorien, and his small host of
            Lórien Elves that stayed with him and Noldor elves, the last of
            their kind to remain in Middle-Earth. Galadriel had already departed
            earlier with a great host of Lórien elves, leaving Celeborn as the
            final guardian of Rivendell. Before leaving, Celeborn sent a message
            to Thranduil, the Elven King of Mirkwood, informing him that the
            gates of Rivendell were now locked and the city would soon be lost
            to time, overtaken by the wilderness as the Elves age in Middle-
            Earth came to an end. And so, Rivendell, once a thriving sanctuary
            of Elven knowledge and culture, faded into memory.

          <h2 id="mirkwood">The Land of Mirkwood</h2>
          <img
            src="images/Felegoth_1.png"
            alt="Felegoth in Eryn Lasgalen (Northern Mirkwood)"
          />
          <p>
            Felegoth, located in Eryn Lasgalen (Northern Mirkwood), is the home
            of King Thranduil and the Wood Elves. The Halls of the Elvenking,
            primarily underground, are an intricate cave system beneath the
            forest. Unlike the dark, damp Dwarven halls, Felegoth is bright and
            lush, with gardens and natural beauty, though the caves still hold a
            darker side. The dungeon cells, where Thorin Oakenshield and his
            companions were once held, remain a reminder of its dual purpose as
            both a palace and a fortress.
          </p>

          <p>
            Felegoth was the heart of Mirkwood, the last stronghold of the Elves
            in the East, and a place of peace amidst the dark forest. But after
            the War of the Ring, as the Fourth Age began, Thranduil, the last of
            the Elven Kings, ruled over the final remnants of the Elves in
            Middle-Earth. With the passing of the Elves and the waning of their
            power, the King felt the call of the Sea.
          </p>

          <p>
            When the time came, King Thranduil gathered all Elves who remained
            in Middle-Earth. The Silvan and Sindar Elves of his realm, the
            Noldor who still lingered, and even the distant Avari from the
            eastern lands. Together, they prepared for one final journey. Before
            departing, Thranduil commanded his guards to lock the gates of
            Felegoth and destroy the bridge that crossed its river, so that no
            man or dwarf could ever claim his halls. The torches were
            extinguished, and silence fell upon the caves of the Woodland Realm.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their march westward began in quiet solemnity. Through the desolate
            paths of Mirkwood they walked, the starlight pale through the
            thinning trees. When they reached Lothlórien, they found it
            lifeless. The Mallorn leaves no longer golden, the air heavy and
            still. Upon a low hill beneath the fading trees, they discovered the
            resting place of Arwen Undómiel, where she had laid down her life.
            There King Thranduil ordered a grave of white stone to be raised,
            carved with runes of the Eldar, and the Elves sang their final song
            for her; a lament so touching that even the wind ceased to stir.
          </p>

          <p>
            As they departed Lórien, the Elven horns sounded for the last time.
            Their echoes carried through the dying forest. A final farewell to
            an ages that would never return. The sound drifted like sorrow
            itself, fading into silence as they passed beyond the Anduin.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their road led them to Rivendell, now a ruin overgrown with ivy and
            moss. The terraces once filled with light and song were shrouded in
            shadow. King Thranduil stood upon the broken steps of Elrond's
            House, remembering the days when the valley was alive with laughter
            and wisdom. He bowed his head in respect, then turned away. For even
            the memory of Rivendell was fading into myth.
          </p>

          <p>
            At last they reached the Grey Havens. The sea wind was cold and
            clear, carrying with it the scent of eternity. There the last ships
            awaited, shimmering with faint light upon the water. Thranduil stood
            upon the shore as the waves lapped at his feet, his silver crown
            glinting one final time beneath the setting sun. He gazed back
            eastward toward the lands of Men; to forests now empty, mountains
            veiled in mist, and rivers that no longer remembered their songs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, without a word, he boarded the ship. As the sails caught the
            wind, the vessels glided westward across the sea, toward Valinor,
            where his son Legolas, and father Oropher, and ancient kindreds
            awaited him. The ships vanished into the light beyond the horizon,
            and with them passed the last breath of Elvendom in Middle-Earth.
